Sports Analytics
Problem Statement
Build a sports analytics RAG system that can answer complex queries about player performance, team statistics, and game insights from a collection of sports documents (match reports, player stats, team analyses).

Requirements
Implement Query Decomposition for complex multi-part questions like "Which team has the best defense and how does their goalkeeper compare to the league average?"
Add Contextual Compression to reduce irrelevant information from retrieved documents
Implement Basic Reranking using semantic similarity scores
Include Citation-based responses showing which documents/sources support each claim
Use a vector database (ChromaDB/Pinecone) for document storage
Implement query decomposition using LLM to break complex queries into sub-questions
Add context compression layer to filter retrieved chunks
Simple reranking based on cosine similarity scores
Format responses with proper citations
Sample Queries
"What are the top 3 teams in defense and their key defensive statistics?"
"Compare Messi's goal-scoring rate in the last season vs previous seasons"
"Which goalkeeper has the best save percentage in high-pressure situations?"
Expected Deliverables
Working RAG system with query decomposition
Context compression implementation
Basic reranking mechanism
Citation formatting in responses
